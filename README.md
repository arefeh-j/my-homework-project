# ♟️ Eight Queens Puzzle Solver

A simple and educational implementation of the classic **Eight Queens problem** using the **Backtracking algorithm** in Python.


## About the Project
The Eight Queens problem is one of the most famous problems in computer science. The goal is to place **eight queens on an 8×8 chessboard** so that no two queens threaten each other.

This project uses the **Backtracking algorithm** to find a valid arrangement.  
The code is clean, readable, and perfect for practicing algorithms and recursive thinking.

##  Features
- ✅ Solves the Eight Queens problem using Backtracking  
- ✅ Checks queen safety with `is_safe()` function  
- ✅ Prints the chessboard with `print_board()` function  
- ✅ Finds all possible solutions (in `utils.py`)  
- ✅ Simple and understandable code structure  
- ✅ Great for students and educational projects
